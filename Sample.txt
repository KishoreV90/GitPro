We are unable to test ASBA UAT build as when we launch UA app, it asks for Cust ID. When cust ID is entered and clicked on Update button, nothing is happening.

When I remove cust ID and click on any of the languages, I am able to Navigate to ASBA section but unable to place the bid as End to End flow of placing the bid is not working.

SIT Build release for Login & Registration Module

Personal information - not working


When I modify the build, it fails and it is still shown as inprogress, when i go to details page it is showing as withdrawn



Cust Id linked to PAN number and multiple accounts (Current, Joint, Ind)
